        <p>One of the unique miracles of nature is classical music. Although there is a long tradition of this genre in India, there are very few who leave an impact on your mind with their melodious activity. It is said that it is not important how much you study the scriptures; What is more important is how much the scripture accepts you. Shobha Choudhary is one such practitioner of classical music who has continued her search with constant immersion in sound. If seen this way, classical singing is not only an extension of colorfulness and sweetness but it is also a search for tunes in one's mind, which an artiste wants to do very passionately. Shobha Chaudhary is a follower of that search. She also knows how to hold a gathering and she also feels the light of vocal splendor within herself. Shobha Choudhary got attracted towards music in her childhood itself. The bhajans sung by her mother and the tuneful singing of her father awakened the magic of music in the childhood mind of Shobha Boudhari. Over time, this initial curiosity became the commitment of his life and he devoted himself towards it. With the encouragement of her parents, Shobha Chaudhary took her interest in music seriously and started performing devotional music in small gatherings. Shobha Chaudhary's formal and initial training took place under the supervision of the teachers of Wardha (Maharashtra). Shri Madhavrao Joshi, Pt. Bamanrao Rajurkar (father-in-law of scholar Malini Rajurkar) and Pt. Bala Saheb Poonchwale have honed the classical singing of Shobha Chaudhary. Gayanacharya Padmabhushan Pt. C.R. Shobha Choudhary's musical journey has become beautiful due to the association with Vyas. Shoma Chaudhary's training as a disciple of Thumri queen Vidushi Girijadevi has further enriched her musical journey.
